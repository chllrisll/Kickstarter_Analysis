Based on the observed data of your Kickstarter campaigns we were able to identify some insightful trends. We hope to break down what may be difficult to uncover so you may leverage your previous Kickstarter campaigns with greater success in the future. 
1. Increase your goal targets in: Technology, Film & Video, and Theater Parent Categories 
-double down on your strongest channels, while prioritizing less on low converting channels-
2. In addition: lowering your target goals in the remaining categories to find other areas of oppurtunities
3. Provide us with more parameters for Outcomes; 
ex: what is the time and oppurtinity cost difference in "canceled" and "failed"
4. Overall, further defining the four outcomes could provide further insight
