# Kickstarter Campaign Overview
## Relational Comparisons of Goals and Launch Date Outcomes
### The purpose of this analysis is to understand how outcomes, goals, and time correlate
## Analysis & Challenges
We want to take a deep look at succesful campaigns and outcome variance by goals.

The challenge is understanding the difference between outcomes:

Example: failed vs canceled (main), succesful vs live (minor.)

*I would suggest a 14-21 day parameter for failed vs canceled.*

**Ex: All campaigns that are not tracking to meet goal by atleast 50% in the first 14 days- the outcome = canceled. Campaigns that meet this criteria that then do not attain goal = failed. This could provide further correlations in tracking fulfillment in outcomes that meet/ and fail to meet goal- further understanding your campaigns goals and outcomes.**

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In the Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch chart we take a look at Theater Outcomes based on launch date by time of year/ by months. The data shows a higher success rate in meeting campaign goal in the months of April to August. We can also see a possibe discrepancy in canceled vs failed. Without having a quantitative difference in failed vs canceled in the month of October we see a spike in failed and no canceled campaigns for that month- this could be skewing our data of failed and canceled campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

In the Outcomes_vs_Goals chart we observe one of Louise's most succesful campaigns - Theater/ Play Kickstarters. As one would suspect the lower the goal- the higher the perecentage of meeting goal and this trends down as goal increases until about midway where goal > 30k. The outcomes successful and failed are inversely correlated in this chart.  As stated above I believe adding time parameters further defining the overall percentage succesful, failed and canceled of your campaigns could uncover more findings.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Quantatative differences in the outcomes: failed, canceled, and live.

**Theater/ Plays Kickstarter Campaigns accounted for almost 33% of your successful outcomes for meeting goal. As we took a deep look into this subcategory we see the summer months of April to August had the highest success rate of meeting goal. We can conclude that this is your best sub category and the months of April to August are the best months to launch these campaigns.**

- Two conclusions from the Outcomes Based on Launch Date: The data shows a higher success rate in meeting campaign goal in the months of April to August. We can also see a possibe discrepancy in canceled vs failed. Without having a quantitative difference in failed vs canceled in the month of October we see a spike in failed and no canceled campaigns for that month- this could be skewing our data of failed and canceled campaigns.
- We can conclude on the Outcome Based on Goals: We observe one of Louise's most succesful campaigns - Theater/ Play Kickstarters. As one would suspect the lower the goal- the higher the perecentage of meeting goal and this trends down as goal increases until about midway where goal > 30k. The outcomes successful and failed are inversely correlated in this chart.  As stated above I believe adding time parameters further defining the overall percentage succesful, failed and canceled of your campaigns could uncover more findings.
- The limitations of this data set are as followed; Quantatative differences in the outcomes: failed, canceled, and live.
- The two added charts All_Campaign_Outcomes and All_Successful_SubCategories provide good insight into Campaign Outcomes as a whole and then a further sub-set breakdown of successful Sub-Categories.
